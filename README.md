# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

I have created my first interactive Dashboard on HR Analytics using Power BI with the guidance of an engaging YouTube tutorial by Rishabh Mishra.

Objective: By using data-driven insights, help an organization by enhancing staff performance, increasing employee retention, and lowering attrition.

Action:
Data Cleaning: Use Power Query to Clean the irrelevant and unused data such as removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types. Data Processing: Load and Apply the cleaned data into Power BI. Data Visualization: Create Measures and columns Using DAX functions such as count, sum, calculate, etc.

By providing these insights, the dashboard enables HR managers to take proactive measures to retain top talent, manage attrition, and create a more productive work environment.
